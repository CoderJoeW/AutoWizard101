# Welcome to Project Maelstrom
A wizard101 bot development effort to bring automation to all aspects of the game

As of writing the bot has a very good success rate of automating buying of reagents in the bazaar at a game resolution of 800x600

This project is gonna go a long way and I definitely need to make some actual documentation but for the moment I would rather work to keep improving the project

Using .net 6 core with Winforms

## Why is it called Project Maelstrom?
I am a weather fanatic and love the pure beauty and power of nature and a Maelstrom just looks and sounds super cool :)
